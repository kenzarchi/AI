# About this project 
This project is an inspiration from E1, E2, and E3 of Sebastian Lague  on YouTube, with my teammate 
Asma Dalil, we tried to build our own environment using unity, and we implemented the following pathfinding algorithms :

BFS : Breadth First Search  is a vertex-based method for finding the shortest path in a graph. It employs a Queue data structure that follows the first in, first out principle. In BFS, one vertex is visited and marked at a time, then its neighbors are visited and stored in the queue.

DFS: A recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure is called depth first search or depth first traversal. Traversing a graph entails visiting all of its nodes.

UCS: Uniform-cost search is an uninformed search algorithm that finds a path from the source to the destination by calculating the lowest cumulative cost. Starting at the root, nodes are expanded according to the lowest cumulative cost.
